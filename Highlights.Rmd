* Environmental audits were conducted along six inferred cycling routes in Hamilton.

* Cyclists' perceptions of the routes were explored through a form of photo elicitation.

* Photo elicitation is extended to generate more holistic photo-journeys of cycling routes.

* Cyclists' perceptions should be regularly explored and incorporated in route design.

* Photo-journeys is a useful participatory approach for developing cycling cities.
