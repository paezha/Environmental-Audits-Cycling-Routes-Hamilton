This study seeks to identify and rank which municipal-level policies and other factors are most influential in increasing cycling as a means of everyday transport and improving the real and perceived cycling safety in car-oriented urban centres. This is achieved by identifying the key factors thought to influence cycle use and by establishing a hierarchy of effectiveness of municipal cycling policies. Data was collected through interviews with a panel of experts who also completed a Delphi study, a technique rarely used in cycling policy research, to collect and compare expert opinions to predict the outcomes of policies and external factors. Policies and external factors were scored in a theoretical policy framework according to their perceived relative influence on cycling levels and cycling safety. The results reinforce previous findings in the literature but allow for generalisation in car-oriented urban centres due to the breadth of factors evaluated. It was found that providing cycling infrastructure is perceived to be a prerequisite for inducing utility cycling mode share. External factors such as urban form, the relative attractiveness of cycling to travel by car and wider governmental policy were perceived to have a strong influence. The generation and maintenance of political and public support is also suggested to be critical success factor.},

  abstract = {Bicycle is a sustainable low-carbon transport mode. However, insufficient or unplanned infrastructure leads to decrease in the share of bicycle in many cities of developing nations. In order to increase the bicycle share and to provide safer, faster and more direct routes, a bicycle superhighway is proposed for urban areas. This study identifies the potential of increase in the bicycle share. For maximum utilization of the new infrastructure, an algorithm is presented to identify the optimum number and locations of the connectors between proposed new infrastructure and existing network. Household income levels are incorporated into the decision making process of individual travellers for a better understanding of the modal shift. A real-world case study of Patna, India is chosen to show the application of the proposed superhighway. It is shown that for Patna, the bicycle share can escalate as high as 48\% up from 32\% by providing this kind of infrastructure. However, together with bicycles, allowing motorbikes on the superhighway limits the bicycle share to 44\%. The increase in bicycle share is mainly a result of people switching from motorbike, public transport and walk to the bicycle. Further, to evaluate the benefits of the bicycle superhighway, this study first extends an emission modelling tool to estimate the time-dependent, vehicle-specific emissions under mixed traffic conditions. Allowing only bicyclists on the superhighway improves congested urban areas, reduces emissions, and increases accessibility. However, allowing motorbikes on the superhighway increases emissions significantly in the central part of the urban area and reduces accessibilities by bicycle mode to education facilities which are undesirable. This study elicits that a physically segregated high-quality bicycle superhighway will not only attract current non-cyclist travellers and increase the share of the bicycle mode, but will also reduce negative transport externalities significantly.},

  abstract = {Introduction This article proposes a low-cost approach that transport authorities can use to evaluate small-scale active travel interventions, including estimating health economic benefits from uptake of walking and/or cycling. Methods Themethod combines post-intervention intercept surveys with the re-use of routinely collected count data. While inferior to more robust, longitudinal methods, the approach represents good value use of primary and secondary data at a far lower cost, for interventions unlikely otherwise to be evaluated at all. It makes use of government-supported tools that estimate physical activity health benefits from increased active travel. Findings The article describes an example in which a residential street was closed to through motor traffic, which led to a decline of 90\% in motor traffic volume and uplift in pedestrian and cycle counts. This example is exploratory in nature due to sample size (124 respondents). The intercept survey of pedestrians and cyclists found uplift in perceived quality of the local environment across various indicators. Results suggested that around a third of the increase in pedestrian and cycle counts post-scheme represents new journeys, mainly via mode shift, with most of the remaining two-thirds being diverted journeys. This information is used alongside the before-and-after count data to estimate new cycling and walking trips induced by the route improvement. Finally, the article estimates the health economic benefit resulting from increased physical activity, of approximately \textsterling 500,000 over 20 years. Conclusions The article demonstrates a method for estimating active traveluptake and associated health benefits for smaller schemes. If applied over a number of schemes, the results could then be used to create an evidence base that could be used in assessing possible benefits of future schemes.},

Results suggest that people care about their neighbourhoods and value local amenities, attractive houses, public art, and trees, greenery and open spaces. They are concerned about such mundane issues as litter and poorly kept properties, which they find unattractive. Pictures of narrow alleyways and deserted areas were prevalent in connection with fear and vulnerability. I suggest that as participants construct their views of the built environment, they situate their actual neighbourhoods against idealised `imagined' neighbourhoods, and both the actual surroundings and the idealised construction play into their views of their own place. In addition, it is clear that when participants are asked to take photographs of their neighbourhoods, they think visually. Consequently, participants enact their responses differently in visual research than they do in verbal-only research.},

Interviews with engineers, planners, activists, politicians and academics were conducted to assess which factors were more important in changing cycling practice in ten case studies areas that witnessed very large increases in their cycling commuting mode shares between the censuses of 1996 and 2011. The results show that although the story varies from case to case, some factors had more impact on cycling behaviour than others. Factors beyond the control of local actors, such as cultural, demographic and economic changes, have contributed significantly to an increase in utilitarian cycling in all case studies. In addition to these macro-trends, locally adopted measures have also been effective: the development of pro-cycling policies and programs, as well as the expansion of cycling infrastructure, seem to have heavily influenced cycling in several communities. In some case study areas, the activities and advocacy of cycling groups have been very influential. In a few cases, such as two small mountain communities, a specific event triggered the increase in cycling in the area. More often, however, it was a combination of government-controlled factors and larger macro-trends that created an environment favourable to cycling for transportation in the studied municipalities.},

  abstract = {There is increasing recognition that the neighborhood-built environment influences health outcomes, such as physical activity behaviors, and technological advancements now provide opportunities to examine the neighborhood streetscape remotely. Accordingly, the aims of this methodological study are to: (1) compare the efficiencies of physically and virtually conducting a streetscape audit within the neighborhood context, and (2) assess the level of agreement between the physical (criterion) and virtual (test) audits. Built environment attributes associated with walking and cycling were audited using the New Zealand Systematic Pedestrian and Cycling Environment Scan (NZ-SPACES) in 48 street segments drawn from four neighborhoods in Auckland, New Zealand. Audits were conducted physically (on-site) and remotely (using Google Street View) in January and February 2010. Time taken to complete the audits, travel mileage, and Internet bandwidth used were also measured. It was quicker to conduct the virtual audits when compared with the physical audits ({$\chi$} = 115.3 min (virtual), {$\chi$} = 148.5 min (physical)). In the majority of cases, the physical and virtual audits were within the acceptable levels of agreement (ICC {$\geq$} 0.70) for the variables being assessed. The methodological implication of this study is that Google Street View is a potentially valuable data source for measuring the contextual features of neighborhood streets that likely impact on health outcomes. Overall, Google Street View provided a resource-efficient and reliable alternative to physically auditing the attributes of neighborhood streetscapes associated with walking and cycling. Supplementary data derived from other sources (e.g., Geographical Information Systems) could be used to assess the less reliable streetscape variables.},

Fourteen adults took individual walks in Bristol city centre and photographed their journey; photographs were then discussed during the interview. Participants reported specific engagements with place related to personal connections, the identity of place, and sense of community that resulted in psychological wellbeing benefits.

The authors used the 1449 non-exercise, utilitarian trips to estimate a bicycle route choice model. The model used a choice set generation algorithm based on multiple permutations of path attributes and was formulated to account for overlapping route alternatives. The findings suggest that cyclists are sensitive to the effects of distance, turn frequency, slope, intersection control (e.g. presence or absence of traffic signals), and traffic volumes. In addition, cyclists appear to place relatively high value on off-street bike paths, enhanced neighborhood bikeways with traffic calming features (aka ``bicycle boulevards''), and bridge facilities. Bike lanes more or less exactly offset the negative effects of adjacent traffic, but were no more or less attractive than a basic low traffic volume street. Finally, route preferences differ between commute and other utilitarian trips; cyclists were more sensitive to distance and less sensitive to other infrastructure characteristics for commute trips.},

Pearson's correlation, bivariate quartile analysis, and two different types of regressions were used to measure the relationship between cycling levels and bikeways, as well as other explanatory and control variables. Ordinary Least Squares and Binary Logit Proportions regressions confirm that cities with a greater supply of bike paths and lanes have significantly higher bike commute rates\textemdash even when controlling for land use, climate, socioeconomic factors, gasoline prices, public transport supply, and cycling safety. Standard tests indicate that the models are a good fit, with R2 ranging between 0.60 and 0.65. Computed coefficients have the expected signs for all variables in the various regression models, but not all are statistically significant. Estimated elasticities indicate that both off-street paths and on-street lanes have a similar positive association with bike commute rates in U.S. cities. Our results are consistent with previous research on the importance of separate cycling facilities and provide additional information about the potentially different role of paths vs. lanes. Our analysis also revealed that cities with safer cycling, lower auto ownership, more students, less sprawl, and higher gasoline prices had more cycling to work. By comparison, annual precipitation, the number of cold and hot days, and public transport supply were not statistically significant predictors of bike commuting in large cities.},

Quick build projects involve rapid and low-cost approaches for modifying streetscape design elements to improve pedestrian safety and support walking. This study evaluated quick build projects at two intersections in low-income neighborhoods. Methods Two intersections were identified using a participatory process with community residents. The projects included painted crosswalks and temporary curb extensions to narrow the vehicle traffic lanes. Video and in-person direct observations were conducted before and during implementation to assess the number of pedestrians and vehicles using the intersection and vehicle/driver behaviors. Resident and stakeholder (e.g., public service workers) attitudes towards the projects were captured through surveys and interviews. Results Pedestrian activity increased by 23\% (p = 0.030) and vehicle activity did not change. The number of vehicles that failed to come to a complete stop at a stop sign decreased by 9\% (p = 0.040) and the proportion of vehicles creating two lanes of traffic at the intersection of single-lane streets decreased from 70\% to 0\%. The mean rating regarding whether residents wanted the project to become permanent was 3.1 on a 1\textendash 4 scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The primary concerns noted related to burden to drivers. Stakeholders had positive attitudes towards the project but some noted concerns related to large vehicles' (e.g., fire engines) ability to make turns in the intersection. Conclusions The findings suggest that inexpensive quick build streetscape improvements are promising for increasing pedestrian activity and walking. More research is needed to evaluate long-term outcomes of sustained quick build projects.},

  abstract = {Bike-sharing is one of the fastest growing new modes of transport in the world, with more and more schemes opening every year. This paper examines the trends in a bike-sharing scheme that has been in operation in Cork since 2014. While many studies exist on how bike-sharing schemes are changing mobility in cities across the globe, few studies have looked at the dynamics of these schemes in smaller cities. One of the motivations in looking at a small city like Cork is to determine if smaller cites derive benefits from bike-sharing schemes and can bike-sharing schemes provide a prominent role in these cities. This research found that in a small, compact city like Cork, average trip times recorded are short with regular uses displaying habitual trip patterns. This includes using the same bike stations and following similar routes on a daily or weekly basis. The findings also suggest weather has an impact upon usage, with longer trips more likely during better weather conditions. The findings of the paper provide insights to the dynamics of usage of a smaller bike-sharing scheme and results on how bike-sharing is offering citizens a new transport alternative.},

Setting UK Biobank. Participants 263 450 participants (106 674 (52\%) women; mean age 52.6), recruited from 22 sites across the UK. The exposure variable was the mode of transport used (walking, cycling, mixed mode v non-active (car or public transport)) to commute to and from work on a typical day. Main outcome measures Incident (fatal and non-fatal) CVD and cancer, and deaths from CVD, cancer, or any causes. Results 2430 participants died (496 were related to CVD and 1126 to cancer) over a median of 5.0 years (interquartile range 4.3-5.5) follow-up. There were 3748 cancer and 1110 CVD events. In maximally adjusted models, commuting by cycle and by mixed mode including cycling were associated with lower risk of all cause mortality (cycling hazard ratio 0.59, 95\% confidence interval 0.42 to 0.83, P=0.002; mixed mode cycling 0.76, 0.58 to 1.00, P{$<$}0.05), cancer incidence (cycling 0.55, 0.44 to 0.69, P{$<$}0.001; mixed mode cycling 0.64, 0.45 to 0.91, P=0.01), and cancer mortality (cycling 0.60, 0.40 to 0.90, P=0.01; mixed mode cycling 0.68, 0.57 to 0.81, P{$<$}0.001). Commuting by cycling and walking were associated with a lower risk of CVD incidence (cycling 0.54, 0.33 to 0.88, P=0.01; walking 0.73, 0.54 to 0.99, P=0.04) and CVD mortality (cycling 0.48, 0.25 to 0.92, P=0.03; walking 0.64, 0.45 to 0.91, P=0.01). No statistically significant associations were observed for walking commuting and all cause mortality or cancer outcomes. Mixed mode commuting including walking was not noticeably associated with any of the measured outcomes. Conclusions Cycle commuting was associated with a lower risk of CVD, cancer, and all cause mortality. Walking commuting was associated with a lower risk of CVD independent of major measured confounding factors. Initiatives to encourage and support active commuting could reduce risk of death and the burden of important chronic conditions.},

  abstract = {In the framework of ``smart city'' strategies, cities worldwide are exploiting information and communication technologies to support their efforts in reducing car use. Recent understandings of smart cities suggest to put people at the core, by actively engaging citizens in co-creating innovative urban services. However, notwithstanding the benefits of participatory processes in urban governance are well-known, low receptiveness towards them is still widespread, which can largely hinder the effectiveness of smart city interventions. In this paper we present the experience of a Swiss city, where, against a past background of resistance to participatory processes, a ``living'' lab experiment was set for the co-creation of a behavior change app targeting a reduction in car-based traffic. Motivated by the opportunity to overcome limitations of such apps, the lab turned out to deliver wider benefits than initially expected. In fact, the concrete experience of new mobility behaviors stimulated by the app activated a collective learning process among lab participants. Discussions in the lab thus spontaneously scaled-up to far-reaching and potentially conflicting topics about future mobility scenarios. Furthermore, the protected space of the lab favored strengthening of reciprocal trust between citizens and policy-makers, opening-up possibilities for adoption of participatory practices also in future decision-making.},

  abstract = {Converting park-and-ride to bike-and-ride trips could yield important environmental, energy conservation, and public-health benefits. While cycling in general is becoming increasingly popular in the United States, it still makes up a miniscule portion of access trips to most rail transit stations. At several rail stations of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system, 10 percent or more of access trips are by bicycle, up considerably from a decade earlier. This paper adopts a case-study approach to probe factors that have had a hand in not only cycling grabbing a larger market share of access trips to rail stops, but also in the enlargement of bike access-sheds over time. Both on-site factors, such as increases in the number of secure and protected bicycle parking racks, as well as off-site factors, such as increases in the lineal miles of separated bike-paths and bike boulevards, appear to explain growing use of bicycles for accessing rail stations. The adage ``build it and they will come,'' we argue, holds for bicycle improvements every bit as much as other forms of urban transportation infrastructure. Pro-active partnerships between transit agencies, local municipalities, and bicycle advocacy organizations are critical to ensuring such improvements are made.},

Elicited items concerned perceived risk of infrastructure layouts, fear of traffic, cycling while distracted, use of safety gear, cycling avoidance due to feeling unsafe, and avoidance to cycle in mixed traffic conditions. The data were analyzed with structural equation models. Results show that, in comparison with cyclists in Copenhagen, cyclists in Brisbane perceive mixed traffic infrastructure layouts as less safe, feel more fear of traffic, and are more likely to adopt cycling avoidance as a coping strategy. Results also show that cyclists in Copenhagen tend to use less helmets and to cycle more while being distracted.},

In addition it has become an important outcome measure in child rehabilitation. However, little is known about the level of participation of young children with Developmental Disabilities. The aim of this study was to capture their subjective experiences of participation. An adapted informed consent based on a comic strip was used to get the children's assent. A Photo Elicitation study was used, in which photographs were taken by the children when they were involved in meaningful activities. The photographs were then used to facilitate communication with the children and to initiate in depth-interviews. Forty-seven interviews with 16 children between five and nine years were conducted based on their photographs. This method generated rich data, confirming that young children with Developmental Disabilities were able to inform us accurately on their experiences of participation. Data was analysed by means of an inductive thematic analysis. Results showed that children perceived their participation as satisfying when they can play, learn and join in family gatherings resulting in feelings of inclusion, recognition and belonging. When there are\textemdash on occasions\textemdash moments that their participation was obstructed, the children used two strategies to resolve it. Or they walked away from it and choose not to participate, or when autonomously motivated for the activity, they relied primarily on their context (i.e. mothers) as enabling their participation. Related to the data, children discussed themes related to their person, activities, connections and mediators between those themes. These themes fit well within earlier and current research on the subject of participation.},

Bicycle use in six small cities in the western United States is examined to determine how gender interacts with individual factors and social and physical environments to influence bicycle behavior. Analysis of data from an online survey using a binary logistic regression approach shows strong interaction of gender with individual factors such as safety perception and household responsibilities and, to a lesser degree, with social and environmental factors to influence bicycle behavior.},

  abstract = {With only {$\sim$}20 \% of bicycling crashes captured in official databases, studies on bicycling safety can be limited. New datasets on bicycling incidents are available via crowdsourcing applications, with opportunity for analyses that characterize reporting patterns. Our goal was to characterize patterns of injury in crowdsourced bicycle incident reports from BikeMaps.org. We extracted 281 incidents reported on the BikeMaps.org global mapping platform and analyzed 21 explanatory variables representing personal, trip, route, and crash characteristics. We used a balanced random forest classifier to classify three outcomes: (i) collisions resulting in injury requiring medical treatment; (ii) collisions resulting in injury but the bicyclist did not seek medical treatment; and (iii) collisions that did not result in injury. Results indicate the ranked importance and direction of relationship for explanatory variables. By knowing conditions that are most associated with injury we can target interventions to reduce future risk. The most important reporting pattern overall was the type of object the bicyclist collided with. Increased probability of injury requiring medical treatment was associated with collisions with animals, train tracks, transient hazards, and left-turning motor vehicles. Falls, right hooks, and doorings were associated with incidents where the bicyclist was injured but did not seek medical treatment, and conflicts with pedestrians and passing motor vehicles were associated with minor collisions with no injuries. In Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, bicycling safety would be improved by additional infrastructure to support safe left turns and around train tracks. Our findings support previous research using hospital admissions data that demonstrate how non-motor vehicle crashes can lead to bicyclist injury and that route characteristics and conditions are factors in bicycling collisions. Crowdsourced data have potential to fill gaps in official data such as insurance, police, and hospital reports.},

Focus groups were conducted with participants belonging to one of three categories. Group one consisted of infrequent and non-cyclists (no bicycle riding over the past month), group two were regular bicycle riders (ridden a bicycle at least once in the past month) and group three was composed of CityCycle members. A thematic analytic method was used to analyse the data. Three main themes were found: Accessibility/spontaneity, safety and weather/topography. The lengthy sign-up process was thought to stifle the spontaneity typically thought to attract people to public bike share. Mandatory helmet legislation was thought to reduce spontaneous use. Safety was a major concern for all groups and this included a perceived lack of suitable bicycle infrastructure, as well as regular riders describing a negative attitude of some car drivers. Interestingly, CityCycle riders unanimously perceived car driver attitudes to improve when on CityCycle bicycles relative to riding on personal bicycles. Conclusions: In order to increase the popularity of the CityCycle scheme, the results of this study suggest that a more accessible, spontaneous sign-up process is required, 24/7 opening hours, and greater incentives to sign up new members and casual users, as seeing people using CityCycle appears critical to further take up.},

These methods have been used for a long time in anthropology and sociology; however, they are a relatively new way to research for the majority of disciplines, especially health research. Two effective visual methodologies that could be used in health research are autophotography and photo elicitation.Autophotography:Autophotography is asking participants to take photographs of their environment and then using the photographs as actual data. Autophotography captures the world through the participant?s eyes with subsequent knowledge production.Photo Elicitation:Photo elicitation is using photographs or other visual mediums in an interview to generate verbal discussion to create data and knowledge. Different layers of meaning can be discovered as this method evokes deep emotions, memories, and ideas. Photo elicitation interviews contribute to trustworthiness and rigor of the findings through member checking.Mental Health Research:This article aims to describe the use of autophotography and photo elicitation to compare people with clinically diagnosed depression and people without depression and their ideas about sources of meaning in life and beliefs about the meaning of life. The analytical approach incorporates eight steps. Firstly, data analysis began during the interviews, then came organizing the data, coding the data, structured analysis, detailed analysis, interpretative analysis, creating themes, and the write-up. The steps taken to ensure trustworthiness were Shenton?s credibility, transferability, confirmability, and dependability. This method is a new, innovative, and viable method for mental health researchers.},

  abstract = {Background The majority of commuting trips in the United States are taken by motor vehicle. Yet, lack of regular physical activity has been identified as one of its most significant public health issues, and globally, risks due to physical inactivity are increasing. However, we believe current studies offer an unclear picture of the complex role of the environmental or psychological influences in active travel behavior across urbanicity classifications. Aims To (1) determine an association between objective or subjective measures of the built environment and active transportation, and (2) characterize the associations within both urban and non-urban contexts among a statewide sample of 862 adults residing in Wisconsin. Methods Multivariate logistic regression analysis of subjective data from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) and data from the Wisconsin Assessment of the Social and Built Environment (WASABE), a direct observation audit tool, to test the impacts of subjective perceptions and objective built environment predictors on active transportation in both urban and rural contexts. Results Males, non-married, physically active individuals, those living in urban areas and with higher education levels had greater odds of using active transportation. Bicycle friendliness (aOR = 2.43; 95\% CI: 1.4\textendash 4.2) and presence of non-residential destinations (aOR = 1.03; 95\% CI: 1.01\textendash 1.05) were the strongest objective predictors of active transportation overall. Subjective measures were especially predictive of active transportation in non-urban areas, specifically for participants identifying presence of trails (adjusted odds = 3.71; 95\% CI: 1.5\textendash 9.2) and non-residential destinations nearby (adjusted odds = 2.65; 95\% CI: 0.99\textendash 7.06). Conclusions Active transportation is associated with built environment characteristics and perceived environmental factors, but the specific predictors and strength of associations vary by context. Results suggest perceived bicycle friendliness may be important in urban areas and access to trails for walking and biking may provide important opportunities to promote active transportation in more suburban or rural areas.},

  abstract = {Women are under-represented in commuter cycling in England and Wales. Consequently, women miss out on the health benefits of active commuting over distances where walking is less practical. Similarly, where cycling could replace motorised forms of transport, society is missing out on the wider health benefits associated with reductions in air pollution, road noise and social severance. This paper uses aggregate (ecological) models to investigate the reasons behind the gender gap in cycling. The relative attractiveness of cycling in different areas is described using a set of 17 determinants of commuter cycling mode share: distance, population density, cycle paths, cycle lanes, traffic density, hilliness, temperature, sun, rain, wind, wealth, lower social status, children, green votes, bicycle performance, traffic risk and parking costs. The correlation between these determinants and census-recorded cycling mode share is examined in logit models for commuters who work 2\textendash 5 km from home. The models explain a large share of the variation in cycling levels. There are small but significant differences in the importance of individual determinants between men and women. However, the gender gap is largely explained by a differentiated response to the relative attractiveness of an area for cycling, the sum effect of all determinants. The ratio of male to female cycling rates is greatest in areas that are less attractive for cycling, whereas in the most attractive areas the ratio approaches parity. On average, women require a more conducive environment for cycling than men. Since the typical environment in England and Wales is not conducive for cycling, women are under-represented in commuter cycling rates and miss out on the health dividend. The results suggest improvements to the cycling environment may be moderated by the existing attractiveness of the environment for cycling, with improvements in less attractive areas having a smaller absolute effect on cycling rates.},

  abstract = {Fostering physical activity is an established public health priority for the primary prevention of a variety of chronic diseases. One promising population approach is to seek to embed physical activity in everyday lives by promoting walking and cycling to and from work (`active commuting') as an alternative to driving. Predominantly quantitative epidemiological studies have investigated travel behaviours, their determinants and how they may be changed towards more active choices. This study aimed to depart from narrow behavioural approaches to travel and investigate the social context of commuting with qualitative social research methods. Within a social practice theory framework, we explored how people describe their commuting experiences and make commuting decisions, and how travel behaviour is embedded in and shaped by commuters' complex social worlds. Forty-nine semi-structured interviews and eighteen photo-elicitation interviews with accompanying field notes were conducted with a subset of the Commuting and Health in Cambridge study cohort, based in the UK. The findings are discussed in terms of three particularly pertinent facets of the commuting experience. Firstly, choice and decisions are shaped by the constantly changing and fluid nature of commuters' social worlds. Secondly, participants express ambiguities in relation to their reasoning, ambitions and identities as commuters. Finally, commuting needs to be understood as an embodied and emotional practice. With this in mind, we suggest that everyday decision-making in commuting requires the tactical negotiation of these complexities. This study can help to explain the limitations of more quantitative and static models and frameworks in predicting travel behaviour and identify future research directions.},

Photovoice served as an observational method for producing ethnographically rich data. A total of 19 participants produced over 500 photos about their journeys to and from work and took part in photo-elicitation interviews. Three themes emerged. First, many images depicted `well-being' in commuting, for example, beautiful landscapes. Second, during elicitation interviews, participants described positive images that they intended but failed to capture in photos. Third, those participants who did not depict well-being described a lack of choice in their commuting, while those who acknowledged well-being seemed to do so in order to make practices of commuting meaningful and habitable. While our interpretations of photos of well-being could be subject to a methodological fallacy relating to a preference for positive over negative images in lay photography, we nonetheless suggest that the rich visual and oral narratives indicate a `real' experience, albeit elicited through the photovoice.},

Many cities in the United States have embraced these modes, but creating pedestrian-and-bike-friendly (PBF) cities in the US context is a tall order. The challenge for planners is to create a city where walking and bicycling live safely and comfortably with faster, longer-distance modes. This chapter presents three key principles that are essential to turning car-friendly cities into pedestrian-and-bicycle-friendly cities: distances, protection, and integration. Two other important challenges are also discussed: unleashing the potential of bicycling, and elevating walking and bicycling in regional planning. These are not the only challenges US cities and others like them face, and success in overcoming them does not guarantee success in increasing walking and bicycling. But cities must confront these challenges on their way toward becoming pedestrian-and-bicycle-friendly cities.},

However, there is little insight into the drivers behind this phenomenon, specifically which policy interventions increased cycling rates and which did not. The knowledge gap on the effectiveness of cycling policies seriously limits the potential for learning from the Dutch experience. This paper will address this gap, by exploring the performance of Dutch cycling policies in 22 medium-sized cities since 2000. First, the existing ideas regarding the effectiveness of cycling policy are reviewed. These insights structure the exploration of data from Statistics Netherlands and the Dutch Cyclists' Union, complemented with a survey of local policy-makers by means of an explorative data-mining methodology called rough set analysis. Our findings support the following hypotheses regarding the performance of cycling policy in Dutch cities: first of all, the way cycling policy is implemented seems important: setting measurable and verifiable goals, following through with most of the proposed policy interventions, allowing for experimental measures to be explored and showing strong leadership. Second, providing adequate cycling infrastructure and decreasing the attractiveness of car use (e.g. by increasing parking tariffs and increasing the area of paid on-street car parking) seem to be key drivers. Finally, we found that external circumstances, such as demographic trends, seem to influence cycling policy outcomes. Future research is needed to test these hypotheses.},

Traces were automatically filtered for activities and mode transfers, and matched to a network model. Alternatives were extracted using repeated shortest path searches in which both link attributes and generalized cost coefficients were randomized. The prior distribution for the coefficients was calibrated automatically using only the network. A Path Size Multinomial Logit model revealed that bicycle lanes were preferred to other facility types, especially by infrequent cyclists. Steep slopes were disfavored, especially by women and during commutes. Other negative attributes included length and turns. Traffic volume, traffic speed, number of lanes, crime rates, and nightfall had no effect. Marginal rates of substitution imply a user benefit of bike lanes of \$0.61 USD per km per trip. Coefficients were applied to a trip assignment model that will be used to evaluate prospective investments in bicycle infrastructure in San Francisco.},

Age-friendly cities encourage and support physical activity and social participation among older adults; however, they often do not adequately address active transportation. Our goal was to identify and understand the constraints to active transportation that older adults experience in order to inform the development of viable solutions. Methods: Focus group interviews were conducted with community dwelling older adults (n = 52) living in the City of Oshawa in Ontario, Canada; each focus group targeted a specific demographic to ensure a diverse range of perspectives were represented. Data were analyzed to identify themes; sub-group analyses were conducted to understand the experience of those from low socioeconomic status and culturally diverse groups. Results: Themes pertaining to environmental, individual, and task constraints, as well as their interactions, were identified. Of particular novelty, seemingly non-modifiable constraints (e.g., weather and personal health) interacted with modifiable constraints (e.g., urban design). Culturally diverse and lower socioeconomic groups had more favorable perspectives of their neighborhoods. Conclusion: While constraints to active transportation interact to exacerbate one another, there is an opportunity to minimize or remove constraints by implementing age-friendly policies and practices.},

Wychwood represented a high walkability neighbourhood and Edenbridge-Humber Valley represented a neighbourhood lower in walkability.

The findings of this research highlighted the efficacy of objective measures existing in literature, but these did not adequately capture the holistic relationships between seniors and their surrounding environments. The subjective measures of walkability proved especially important for understanding perceptions of walkability and walking behaviour.

Infrastructure quality and the route choices of cyclists have been well studied, but often solely based on a quantitative approach, leading to tools such as BLOS (bicycle level of service). With various designs of cargo bikes being used for a wide range of purposes, the route choice of cargo bike users is difficult to generalize. This study combines quantitative and qualitative approaches in order to explore what is important for cargo bike users' route choice, and how this knowledge can be effectively used for planning. Our results suggest that while some general preferences exist, route choice involves complex dynamics that cannot be fully explained by quantitative measures alone: in addition to understanding ``what'' is important for cargo bike users, we need to understand ``why'' it is important. Furthermore, route choice is also influenced by the city context, making a study tailored to the local context essential.},

A dataset containing 161,426 GPS trajectories describing observed routes of cyclists using SoBi bikes over a 12-month period (April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016) is used for analysis. This study groups trips by origin-destination hub pairs and uses a GIS (geographic information system)-based map-matching algorithm to generate routes along with attributes such as length, number of intersections, number of turns, and unique road segments. Unique routes and their use frequencies are extracted from all the hub-to-hub trips using a GIS-based link signature extraction tool developed for this research. The most popular routes between hubs taken by cyclists are then identified as dominant routes and their attributes are compared to those of corresponding shortest path routes derived by minimizing distance traveled. The comparison finds significant differences in multiple attributes, and demonstrates that dominant routes are significantly longer than their shortest distance counterparts, suggesting that cyclists are willing to detour for routes characterized by positive features such as bicycle facilities and low traffic volumes. Detouring does, however, come at a cost \textendash{} increases in number of turns and number of intersections. This research not only enhances our understanding of cyclist route preferences within a bike share system, it also presents a GIS-based approach for identifying potential locations for future bike facilities based on such preferences.},

  abstract = {Cycling is the most energy-efficient mode of transport and can bring extensive environmental, social and economic benefits. Research has highlighted negative perceptions of safety as a major barrier to the growth of cycling. Understanding these perceptions through the application of novel place-sensitive methodological tools such as mental mapping could inform measures to increase cyclist numbers and consequently improve cyclist safety. Key steps to achieving this include: (a) the design of infrastructure to reduce actual risks and (b) targeted work on improving safety perceptions among current and future cyclists. This study combines mental mapping, a stated-preference survey and a transport infrastructure inventory to unpack perceptions of cycling risk and to reveal both overlaps and discrepancies between perceived and actual characteristics of the physical environment. Participants translate mentally mapped cycle routes onto hard-copy base-maps, colour-coding road sections according to risk, while a transport infrastructure inventory captures the objective cycling environment. These qualitative and quantitative data are matched using Geographic Information Systems and exported to statistical analysis software to model the individual and (infra)structural determinants of perceived cycling risk. This method was applied to cycling conditions in Galway City (Ireland). Participants' (n=104) mental maps delivered data-rich perceived safety observations (n=484) and initial comparison with locations of cycling collisions suggests some alignment between perception and reality, particularly relating to danger at roundabouts. Attributing individual and (infra)structural characteristics to each observation, a Generalised Linear Mixed Model statistical analysis identified segregated infrastructure, road width, the number of vehicles as well as gender and cycling experience as significant, and interactions were found between individual and infrastructural variables. The paper concludes that mental mapping is a highly useful tool for assessing perceptions of cycling risk with a strong visual aspect and significant potential for public participation. This distinguishes it from more traditional cycling safety assessment tools that focus solely on the technical assessment of cycling infrastructure. Further development of online mapping tools is recommended as part of bicycle suitability measures to engage cyclists and the general public and to inform `soft' and `hard' cycling policy responses.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between the objectively measured and perceived built environment, and the relative strength of their association with bicycling behavior. By drawing on socio-cognitive theory, a conceptual model was proposed to explain the relationships between the objective environment, perceived environment, and bicycling behavior. Objective and perceived bike environments were measured using two latent constructs and structural equation modeling was employed to estimate the models based on data from three neighborhoods in Portland, Oregon. Results of this study showed that the perception of the environment had a direct and significant effect on bicycling behavior, while the direct effect of the objective environment on bicycling behavior became insignificant when controlling for perception. We therefore concluded that the objective environment may only indirectly affect bicycling behavior by influencing perceptions. An objectively good environment for bicycling was necessary but not sufficient for bicycling. Intervention programs to improve people's perceptions of the environment may be necessary to reap the full potential of planning and design policies.},

We show that this effort, in such a short period of time, has been a valuable tool for the promotion of bicycle mobility in a city without a tradition for cycling. Apart from the obvious aim of achieving segregation from motorized traffic, the Seville network considered connectivity, continuity, visibility, uniformity, bi-directionality and comfort as criteria for the design of the infrastructure. All these criteria aim to make cycling not just safe, but also easy and comfortable for everybody. Our analysis also suggests that the fast building of this type of infrastructure provides solid grounds for the development of utilitarian cycling, with high cost effectiveness, even in a city without a previous tradition in this sense. However the strategy also has certain limitations, which are analysed in the paper.},

  abstract = {Introduction Despite bicycling being considered ten times more dangerous than driving, the evidence suggests that high-bicycling-mode-share cities are not only safer for bicyclists but for all road users. We look to understand what makes these cities safer. Are the safety differences related to `safety-in-numbers' of bicyclists, or can they be better explained by built environment differences or the people that inhabit them? Methods Based on thirteen years of data from twelve large U.S. cities, we investigated over 17,000 fatalities and 77,000 severe injuries across nearly 8700 block groups via multilevel, longitudinal, negative binomial regression models. We hypothesize three pathways towards better road safety outcomes: i) travel behavior differences (e.g. `safety-in-numbers' or shifts to `safer' modes); ii) built environment differences (e.g. infrastructure that helps promote safer environments); and iii) socio-demographic/socio-economic differences (e.g. some cities may be populated by those with lower road safety risk). Results The results suggest that more bicyclists is not the reason these cities are safer for all road users. Better safety outcomes are instead associated with a greater prevalence of bike facilities \textendash{} particularly protected and separated bike facilities \textendash{} at the block group level and, more strongly so, across the overall city. Higher intersection density, which typically corresponds to more compact and lower-speed built environments, was strongly associated with better road safety outcomes for all road users. The variables representing gentrification also accounted for much of our explainable variation in safety outcomes. Conclusions This paper provides an evidence-based approach to building safer cities. While the policy implications of this work point to protected and separated bike infrastructure as part of the solution, we need to keep in mind that these approaches are complementary and should not be considered in isolation. Moreover, our results \textendash{} particularly the safety disparities associated with gentrification \textendash{} suggest equity issues and the need for future research.},

Overall, results showed that people living in neighbourhoods with a preponderance of speed limits below 30km/h, many bicycle lanes, with less traffic calming devices, more trees, more litter and many parked cars forming an obstacle on the road were more likely to cycle for transport than people living in areas with lower prevalence of these factors. Evidence was only found for seven out of 56 possible moderators of these associations.

The research is based on a combination of statistical analysis of travel diary data and field work to conduct walkability audits. The approach follows a sequence of logical steps. The first step involves the estimation of a travel behavior model walking by seniors (people 65years or older). The results of this model, in combination with cluster analysis, are used to identify sites where the model systematically under- or over-predicts walking. Subsequently, sites are targeted for walkability audits. It then becomes possible to assess the presence or absence of attributes of built environments where walking is more or less common than other factors would predict. A walkability audit of 403 street segments was used to proof the concept in this paper. The audited items were summarized in contingency tables and tested with the chi-squared test of independence to identify streetscape elements that correlate with walking for transportation.},

In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to select sites for conducting walkability audits. The key idea is to estimate a model of travel behavior at the meso-scale level, which can be examined to identify locations where the behavior is under- and over-estimated. We conjecture that systematic under- and over-estimation can be caused by micro-level factors that influence the behavior. The results can be used to identify sites for walkability audits. The approach is demonstrated with a case study in Hamilton, Canada. A model of walk shares forms the basis of the site selection procedure. After identifying areas with higher and lower shares than predicted by the model we select a sample of neighborhoods for audits. Analysis of the results reveals elements of the local environment that associate with greater-than-expected walk shares. The case study demonstrates that the proposed model-based strategy can be used to better target limited resources, and produce valuable insights into micro-level factors that affect travel behavior.},

Binary logit model findings provide new insights on who bicycles, and on perceived and actual built environmental conditions associated with the likelihood of cycling in neighborhoods, controlling for socio-demographic variables. A high 21\% of the respondents report cycling at least once a week in their neighborhood, more often for recreation or exercise than for transportation. Cycling is more popular among male, younger adults, transit users, and those who are physically active and in good health. Both perceived and objective environmental conditions contribute to the likelihood of cycling. Proximity to trails and the presence of agglomerations of offices, clinics/hospitals, and fast food restaurants, measured objectively, are significant environmental variables. Previously researched correlates of cycling, such as the presence of bicycle lanes, traffic speed and volume, slope, block size, and the presence of parks, are found insignificant when objectively measured. A non-linear relationship is found between the odds of cycling and the perception of traffic problems and automobile-oriented facilities. Overall, cycling is only moderately associated with the neighborhood environment. It appears to be an individual choice that is independent from environmental support. This finding likely reflects the limited bicycle infrastructure in the sample frame\textemdash an unfortunate condition found in most US metropolitan regions. Policy and intervention programs could increase cycling by improving both actual and perceived environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This paper reviews existing environmental audit instruments used to capture the walkability and bikability of environments. The review inventories and evaluates individual measures of environmental factors used in these instruments. It synthesizes the current state of knowledge in quantifying the built environment. The paper provides health promotion professionals an understanding of the essential aspects of environments influencing walking and bicycling for both recreational and transportation purposes. It serves as a basis to develop valid and efficient tools to create activity-friendly communities. DATA SOURCES: Keyword searches identified journal articles from the computer-based Academic Citation Databases, including the National Transportation Library, the Web of Science Citation Database, and MEDLINE. Governmental publications and conference proceedings were also searched. STUDY INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA: All instruments to audit physical environments have been included in this review, considering both recreation- and transportation related walking and bicycling. Excluded are general methods devised to estimate walking and cycling trips, those used in empirical studies on land use and transportation, and research on walking inside buildings. DATA EXTRACTION METHODS: Data have been extracted from each instrument using a template of key items developed for this review. The data were examined for quality assurance among three experienced researchers. DATA SYNTHESIS: A behavioral model of the built environment guides the synthesis according to three components: the origin and destination of the walk or bike trip, the characteristics of the road traveled, and the characteristics of the areas surrounding the trip's origin and destination. These components, combined with the characteristics of the instruments themselves, lead to a classification of the instruments into the four categories of inventory, route quality assessment, area quality assessment, and approaches to estimating latent demand for walking and bicycling. Furthermore, individual variables used in each instrument to measure the environment are grouped into four classes: spatiophysical, spatiobehavioral, spatiopsychosocial, and policy-based. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Individually, existing instruments rely on selective classes of variables and therefore assess only parts of built environments that affect walking and bicycling. Most of the instruments and individual measures have not been rigorously tested because of a lack of available data on walking and bicycling and because of limited research budgets. Future instrument development will depend on the acquisition of empirical data on walking and bicycling, on inclusion of all three components of the behavioral model, and on consideration of all classes of variables identified.},

  abstract = {Cities around the world and in the US are implementing bikesharing systems, which allow users to access shared bicycles for short trips, typically in the urban core. Yet few scholars have examined the determinants of bikeshare station usage using a fine-grained approach. We estimate a series of Bayesian regression models of trip generation at stations, examining the effects bicycle infrastructure, population and employment, land use mix, and transit access separately by season of the year, weekday/weekend, and user type (subscriber versus casual). We find that bikeshare stations located near busy subway stations and bicycle infrastructure see greater utilization, and that greater population and employment generally predict greater usage. Our findings are nuanced, however; for instance, those areas with more residential population are associated with more trips by subscribers and on both weekdays and non-working days; however, the effect is much stronger on non-working days. Additional nuances can be found in how various land use variables affect bikeshare usage. We use our models, based on 2014 data, to forecast the trips generated at new stations opened in 2015. Results suggest there is large variation in predictive power, partly caused by variation in weather, but also by other factors that cannot be predicted. This leads us to the conclusion that the nuances we find in our inferential analysis are more useful for transportation planners.},

Photovoice is one of several qualitative methods utilized in CBPR, as it is a participatory method that has community participants use photography, and stories about their photographs, to identify and represent issues of importance to them. Over the past several years photovoice methodology has been frequently used to explore community health and social issues. One emerging opportunity for the utilization of photovoice methodology is research on community built and social environments, particularly when looking at the context of the neighbourhood. What is missing from the current body of photovoice literature is a critique of the strengths and weaknesses of photovoice as a method for health promotion research (which traditionally emphasizes capacity-building, community-based approaches) and as a method for revealing residents' perceptions of community as a source of health opportunities or barriers. This paper will begin to address this gap by discussing the successes and challenges of using the photovoice methodology in a recent CBPR project to explore community perceptions of the built and social environment (with the ultimate goal of informing community-based chronic disease prevention initiatives). The paper concludes with methodological recommendations and directions for future research.},

The case study is McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, and data was obtained by means of a web-based survey that included questions regarding travel behavior, socio-demographic information, and attitudes toward travel, land use, and the environment. The objective variable is defined as the ratio of ideal to actual commute time, and regression analysis is implemented to test the relationship between this variable and socio-demographic variables and attitudinal scores. The impact of different attitudes on the gap between ideal and actual commute time is expanded to include three different modes, active travel (walk/cycle), transit, and personal automobile. Interestingly, the results indicate that active travelers tend to be less dissatisfied with their commute, followed by those who travel in a personal vehicle and transit users. A number of attitudinal responses are shown to impact the desire to travel more or less, including variables that relate to the social environment, availability of local activities, quality of facilities, productive use of the commute, and the intrinsic value found in the commute travel. The picture emerges of a traveler who would like to spend more time commuting, as someone who is an active traveler, thinks that getting there is half the fun, dislikes traveling alone, but rather likes to live in an active neighborhood where there is a sense of community. The results suggests that enjoyment of commuting, while a challenge from the perspective of motorized mobility, may provide valuable policy opportunities from the perspective of active transportation.},

  abstract = {The focus for interventions and research on physical activity has moved away from vigorous activity to moderate-intensity activities, such as walking. In addition, a social ecological approach to physical activity research and practice is recommended. This approach considers the influence of the environment and policies on physical activity. Although there is limited empirical published evidence related to the features of the physical environment that influence physical activity, urban planning and transport agencies have developed policies and strategies that have the potential to influence whether people walk or cycle in their neighbourhood. This paper presents the development of a framework of the potential environmental influences on walking and cycling based on published evidence and policy literature, interviews with experts and a Delphi study. The framework includes four features: functional, safety, aesthetic and destination; as well as the hypothesised factors that contribute to each of these features of the environment. In addition, the Delphi experts determined the perceived relative importance of these factors. Based on these factors, a data collection tool will be developed and the frameworks will be tested through the collection of environmental information on neighbourhoods, where data on the walking and cycling patterns have been collected previously. Identifying the environmental factors that influence walking and cycling will allow the inclusion of a public health perspective as well as those of urban planning and transport in the design of built environments.},

We describe the development of a comprehensive instrument to measure the physical environmental factors that may influence walking and cycling in local neighborhoods and report on its reliability. METHODS: Following consultation with experts from a variety of fields and a literature search, we developed a Systematic Pedestrian and Cycling Environmental Scan (SPACES) instrument and used it to collect data over a total of 1987 kilometers of roads in metropolitan Perth, Western Australia. The audit instrument is available from the first author on request. Additional environmental information was collected using desktop methods and geographic information systems (GIS) technology. We assessed inter- and intra-rater reliability of the instrument among the 16 observers who collected the data. RESULTS: The observers reported that the audit instrument was easy to use. Both inter- and intra-rater reliability of the environmental scan instrument were generally high. CONCLUSIONS: Our instrument provides a reliable, practical, and easy-to-use method for collecting detailed "street-level" data on physical environmental factors that are potential influences on walking in local neighborhoods.},

Methods This analysis, conducted in 2016\textendash 2017, utilized data from the 2012 National Survey of Bicyclist and Pedestrian Attitudes and Behaviors (n=7,509; N=246,155,593). Weighted logistic regression models were utilized to examine the association between intrapersonal, perceived environment, and objective environment variables and total, recreation, and transportation bicycling. Results Significant differences were identified when bicyclists were compared with non-bicyclists. Respondents whose most recent ride was for recreation had significantly higher odds of being male, younger, white, and college educated, and significantly lower odds of being retired or a homemaker. Respondents who reported that their most recent ride was for transportation had significantly higher odds of being male, younger, and a student, and had significantly lower odds of being a high school graduate. Transportation riders also had significantly higher odds of perceived presence of a bike lane or path within one-quarter mile of their residence, and living in a more rural area. Conclusions In the U.S., recreation bicycling is a choice-based behavior, whereas transportation bicycling may be more influenced by the perceived and objective built environment. Interventions should consider how to make recreation and transportation bicycling more accessible and affordable to all individuals.},

We analyze aggregate data for the two countries as well as city-specific case study data for nine large cities (Chicago, Minneapolis, Montr\'eal, New York, Portland, San Francisco, Toronto, Vancouver, and Washington). Cycling levels have increased in both the USA and Canada, while cyclist fatalities have fallen. There is much spatial variation and socioeconomic inequality in cycling rates. The bike share of work commuters is more than twice as high in Canada as in the USA, and is higher in the western parts of both countries. Cycling is concentrated in central cities, especially near universities and in gentrified neighborhoods near the city center. Almost all the growth in cycling in the USA has been among men between 25\textendash 64years old, while cycling rates have remained steady among women and fallen sharply for children. Cycling rates have risen much faster in the nine case study cities than in their countries as a whole, at least doubling in all the cities since 1990. They have implemented a wide range of infrastructure and programs to promote cycling and increase cycling safety: expanded and improved bike lanes and paths, traffic calming, parking, bike-transit integration, bike sharing, training programs, and promotional events. We describe the specific accomplishments of the nine case study cities, focusing on each city's innovations and lessons for other cities trying to increase cycling. Portland's comprehensive package of cycling policies has succeeded in raising cycling levels 6-fold and provides an example that other North American cities can follow.},

Interventions include infrastructure (e.g., bike lanes and parking), integration with public transport, education and marketing programs, bicycle access programs, and legal issues. METHODS: A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed and non-reviewed research identified 139 studies. Study methodologies varied considerably in type and quality, with few meeting rigorous standards. Secondary data were gathered for 14 case study cities that adopted multiple interventions. RESULTS: Many studies show positive associations between specific interventions and levels of bicycling. The 14 case studies show that almost all cities adopting comprehensive packages of interventions experienced large increases in the number of bicycle trips and share of people bicycling. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the evidence examined in this review supports the crucial role of public policy in encouraging bicycling. Substantial increases in bicycling require an integrated package of many different, complementary interventions, including infrastructure provision and pro-bicycle programs, supportive land use planning, and restrictions on car use.},

The analysis relies on national aggregate data as well as case studies of large and small cities in each country. The key to achieving high levels of cycling appears to be the provision of separate cycling facilities along heavily travelled roads and at intersections, combined with traffic calming of most residential neighbourhoods. Extensive cycling rights of way in the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany are complemented by ample bike parking, full integration with public transport, comprehensive traffic education and training of both cyclists and motorists, and a wide range of promotional events intended to generate enthusiasm and wide public support for cycling. In addition to their many pro-bike policies and programmes, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany make driving expensive as well as inconvenient in central cities through a host of taxes and restrictions on car ownership, use and parking. Moreover, strict land-use policies foster compact, mixed-use developments that generate shorter and thus more bikeable trips. It is the coordinated implementation of this multi-faceted, mutually reinforcing set of policies that best explains the success of these three countries in promoting cycling. For comparison, the article portrays the marginal status of cycling in the UK and the USA, where only about 1\% of trips are by bike.},

Most of these factors result from differences between Canada and the United States in their transport and land-use policies, and not from intrinsic differences in history, culture or resource availability.

This article investigates the potential for active commuting by bicycle in Scania county, southern Sweden, and its possible impact on public health. Physical inactivity is a growing problem on both an individual and a societal level. Method, setting and population A complete statistical survey and geographic analysis has been carried out based on data concerning the home and work addresses of the entire working population in the county of Scania, Sweden as of the end of 2014. This data set includes a total of 575,959 individuals. Results Approximately 27.9\% of the population can reach their workplace by a 15-min bicycle commute, while 47.2\% can reach their workplace in 30 min. It is possible to achieve a 47.2\% modal share for active transport in Scania if all individuals within cycling distance of work choose to commute by bicycle. If that were to happen, 19.2\% of the working population would meet the WHO's global health recommendations just through their commutes. Conclusion The results demonstrate that the spatial distribution of homes and workplaces in Scania is conducive to increasing the mode share for active transport through well-designed physical environments and transport systems that prioritise physical activity.},

  abstract = {Introduction Promoting walking and bicycling has been a major focus in the US in recent years. Bicyclist and pedestrian manual counting programs are used to measure how many people are walking and bicycling in specific locations and their characteristics. The purpose of this study was to understand how communities use this data and assess the potential to use manual count data for assessment and evaluation. Methods Six communities in Minnesota were selected to participate in this study. One semi-structured interview per community was conducted with local public health staff who participated in manual counts in 2012, 2014, and 2016. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Results Communities described their motivation to conduct counts, management of existing programs, and how they interpreted and used the count data. Among the many uses of the data discussed were documenting use of facilities, allocating resources, assessing efficiency of investments or need for safety interventions, informing or conducting research, and community engagement. Communities also described how the setting and circumstances that exist in the community affect both data interpretation and implications of the data as well as barriers, facilitators, and technical assistance needs for collecting and using count data effectively. Conclusions Communities may need technical assistance to know how to use data collected through bicyclist and pedestrian manual counting. However, with appropriate instruction and assistance, counts are a feasible assessment tool for local active transportation (bicycling and walking) promotion efforts. However, contextual information about the setting and circumstances that exist in local communities is necessary to properly interpret and use count data and therefore is also necessary when using counts for assessment or evaluation. This method supports equity as manual counts do not require expensive equipment, and are relatively easy to implement.},

The health effects of active travel in populations of low socioeconomic status (SES) are unclear. This study was performed to investigate the associations of cycling and walking for travel with diabetes and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a multi-ethnic, low-SES population. Methods Cross-sectional data from 2445 adults (age, 48.0 {$\pm$} 9.8 years; 43.6\% men) in two multi-ethnic, low-SES districts in Oslo, Norway, were collected. The data included objective measurements (blood pressure, weight, height, blood parameters), questionnaire data (physical activity, diabetes, use of medication, working status, education, smoking), sex, age, and country of origin. Associations were analyzed by multiple logistic regression models. Results Cycling and walking for travel were performed by 26.5\% and 80.1\% of adults, respectively.

A GIS-based map-matching algorithm is used to derive users' routes along the cycling network within Hamilton, Ontario and generate multiple attributes for each route, such as route distance, route directness, average distance between intersections, and the number of turns, intersections, and unique road segments. Concerning route choice analysis, the origin and destination pair should be the same for all routes within a choice set, thus HBS users' trips are grouped by origin-destination hub pairs. Since trips taken by different users between a hub pair can follow the same route, unique routes are extracted using a link signature extraction tool. Following this, a normalized Gini (Gn) coefficient is calculated for each hub pair to evaluate users' preferences among all the unique hub-to-hub route choices. A Gn closer to 0 indicates that routes between a hub pair are more evenly used, while a value closer to 1 implies a higher preference toward one dominant route. Three route choice models, a global model, a medium Gn model, and a high Gn model, are estimated using Path-Size Logit to determine how route choice is affected by the presence of dominant routes. These models suggest that HBS users are willing to detour for some attributes, such as bicycle facilities, but tend to avoid circuitous routes, turns, steep slopes, and roads with high traffic volume.},

  abstract = {Background Bicycling shows potential for addressing both health and transportation challenges. One strategy to encourage more people to bicycle is skills training courses; however, there is limited evidence for their effectiveness, especially longer-term. We assessed the impact of adult bicycle skills training programs offered in Metro Vancouver, Canada, using a longitudinal, quasi-experimental study design to compare changes in bicycling and confidence over time between course participants and a comparison group. Methods Bicycle courses delivered by accredited instructors, 2 to 4.5 hours in duration, aimed to increase participant comfort level to ride on residential and urban streets through teaching in-person and on-road traffic handling skills. We collected data in 2016 and 2017 through online questionnaires at baseline, 1, 3, and 12 months post-course, and used mixed models to assess changes. Results We enrolled 135 course and 43 comparison participants. At baseline, 32 participants reported no bicycling; 18 started bicycling during the study. Adjusted models did not find different trajectories for course and comparison participants for bicycling overall (RR=0.99, 95\% CI: 0.96, 1.02) or for any specific purpose (commuting RR=1.03, 95\% CI: 0.99, 1.08; errands RR=0.97, 95\% CI: 0.93, 1.01; leisure RR=0.96, 95\% CI: 0.93, 1.00), or for confidence. Conclusion: Bicycle courses aim to address individual-level barriers to bicycling, such as skills, knowledge, and confidence, but such courses may not be enough to overcome other barriers. Bicycle courses should be combined with environmental and other means of support to achieve greater impact on bicycling.},

  abstract = {Background Transport mobility has the potential to greatly affect teenagers׳ ability to independently access their social networks, key activities and destinations. Consequently, it makes sense to consider the role that transport plays in influencing well-being among older adolescents. The aim of this study was to investigate how older teenagers perceive the impact of transport on their well-being. Methods Participatory photography or ``photovoice'' uses photographs taken by those with seemingly little power or status in order to enhance community needs assessments, to empower participants, and to provide a comprehensive description of an issue. This method was utilized among senior secondary school students aged 16\textendash 18 in Southland, New Zealand (n=18; 50\% male). Their group discussions of common themes concerning transport and well-being provided richness and depth to each photograph displayed. Results Photographs and resulting discussions suggested that transport infrastructure played a key role in supporting well-being among participants. Regardless of the destination, photos and narratives by participants who lived close to town, and who were able to walk to destinations as part of their daily trip chain, displayed independence, happiness and positive social aspects of well-being. Living farther away from town elicited photo stories of loneliness and decreased autonomy, with respect to transport. Conclusions Transport had an influence on the well-being of this group of teenagers. Photovoice projects are a valuable way to engage youth and provide context for new research topics such as this. New knowledge generated by this project will inform future research focused on transport as a correlate of well-being among youth.},

  abstract = {Introduction Bicycling is promoted as a transportation and population health strategy globally. Yet bicycling has low uptake in North America (1\%\textendash 2\% of trips) compared with European bicycling cities (15\%\textendash 40\% of trips) and shows marked sex and age trends. Safety concerns due to collisions with motor vehicles are primary barriers.To attract the broader population to bicycling, many cities are making investments in bicycle infrastructure. These interventions hold promise for improving population health given the potential for increased physical activity and improved safety, but such outcomes have been largely unstudied. In 2016, the City of Victoria, Canada, committed to build a connected network of infrastructure that separates bicycles from motor vehicles, designed to attract people of `all ages and abilities' to bicycling.This natural experiment study examines the impacts of the City of Victoria's investment in a bicycle network on active travel and safety outcomes. The specific objectives are to (1) estimate changes in active travel, perceived safety and bicycle safety incidents; (2) analyse spatial inequities in access to bicycle infrastructure and safety incidents; and (3) assess health-related economic benefits. Methods and analysis The study is in three Canadian cities (intervention: Victoria; comparison: Kelowna, Halifax). We will administer population-based surveys in 2016, 2018 and 2021 (1000 people/city). The primary outcome is the proportion of people reporting bicycling. Secondary outcomes are perceived safety and bicycle safety incidents. Spatial analyses will compare the distribution of bicycle infrastructure and bicycle safety incidents across neighbourhoods and across time. We will also calculate the economic benefits of bicycling using WHO's Health Economic Assessment Tool. Ethics and dissemination This study received approval from the Simon Fraser University Office of Research Ethics (study no. 2016s0401). Findings will be disseminated via a website, presentations to stakeholders, at academic conferences and through peer-reviewed journal articles.},

  abstract = {This paper contributes to debates on gender, mobility and planning through an analysis of Cycling Level of Service tools (CLoS). Whilst many UK cities have had some success increasing overall cycling numbers in recent years, women are still far less likely to cycle, often because of concerns with journey quality related to traffic safety and social safety. CLoS tools are used by planners and engineers to assess existing routes and ensure they are safe, direct and continuous. However, whilst CLoS tools are seen to provide objective measures of some principles, we argue that they fail to attribute enough importance to gendered differences in perceptions of social safety. Based upon qualitative go-along and interview data, we assess the Welsh CLoS tool, demonstrating that it allows routes considered to be unrideable by female cyclists to be designated as rideable because there is no requirement to take mandatory remedial action regarding what are shown to be critically low scores on indicators of social safety. Whilst larger studies are required to validate these findings, our data suggests that the safety component of the CLoS tool can only be considered objective from a male point of view and inadequately considers the perspectives and needs of women. Moreover, we argue that in mandating socially unsafe routes as safe, CLoS actively reproduces gendered `essences' such as vulnerability. As a result we suggest that CLoS urgently needs to be incorporated into gender and equalities audits if it is to accurately reflect the needs of more diverse user groups.},

  abstract = {Introduction Cycling behavior has recently attracted great research attention as an important type of physical activity and sustainable mode of transportation. In addition, cycling provides other environmental benefits, such as reducing air pollution and traffic congestion. Various built environment factors have been demonstrated to be associated with the popularity of cycling behaviors. However, the most recent built environment cycling reviews were conducted nearly 10 years ago, and these reviews reached no clear consensus on which built environment factors are associated with which domain of cycling behaviors. To determine the crucial features of a cycling-friendly city, it is therefore necessary to conduct a review based on empirical studies from the last decade (2007\textendash 2017). Methods Thirty-nine empirical studies published in peer-reviewed journals between 2007 and 2017 were retrieved and reviewed. The results were summarized based on built environment factors and four domains of cycling behaviors (transport, commuting, recreation, and general). Weighted elasticity values for built environment factors were calculated to estimate effect sizes. Results We found consistent associations with large effect sizes between street connectivity and cycling for commuting and transport. The presence of cycling paths and facilities was found to be positively associated with both commuting cycling and general cycling. However, the effects of land-use mix, availability of cycling paths to non-residential destinations, and terrain slope on cycling behaviors remained weak. The effects of urban density and other built environment factors are mixed. Conclusions This review has demonstrated that street connectivity and the presence of cycling paths and facilities are the two most significant built environment factors that may promote cycling behaviors. With the emergence of advanced measurement methods for both the built environment and cycling behaviors, further studies may overcome current research limitations and provide robust evidence to support urban planning and public-health practice.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the evolution of urban cycling in Montreal, Canada and its link to both built environment indicators and bicycle infrastructure accessibility. The effect of new cycling infrastructure on transport-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is then explored. More specifically, we aim at investigating how commuting cycling modal share has evolved across neighborhood built-environment typologies and over time in Montreal, Canada. For this purpose, automobile and bicycle trip information from origin\textendash destination surveys for the years 1998, 2003 and 2008 are used. Neighborhood typologies are generated from different built environment indicators (population and employment density, land use diversity, etc.). Furthermore, to represent the commuter mode choice (bicycle vs automobile), a standard binary logit and simultaneous equation modeling approach are adopted to represent the mode choice and the household location. Among other things, we observe an important increase in the likelihood to cycle across built environment types and over time in the study region. In particular, urban and urban-suburb neighborhoods have experienced an important growth over the 10 years, going from a modal split of 2.8\textendash 5.3\% and 1.4\textendash 3.0\%, respectively. After controlling for other factors, the model regression analysis also confirms the important increase across years as well as the significant differences of bicycle ridership across neighborhoods. A statistically significant association is also found between the index of bicycle infrastructure accessibility and bike mode choice \textendash{} an increase of 10\% in the accessibility index results in a 3.7\% increase in the ridership. Based on the estimated models and in combination with a GHG inventory at the trip level, the potential impact of planned cycling infrastructure is explored using a basic scenario. A reduction of close to 2\% in GHG emissions is observed for an increase of 7\% in the length of the bicycle network. Results show the important benefits of bicycle infrastructure to reduce commuting automobile usage and GHG emissions.},
